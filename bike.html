            <p>
            This is my electric mountain bike which is a converted Haro hardtail
            using a Bafang 750W motor + controller and a 11000 mAh 52V battery
            pack. I built this over the summer of 2021 and have been using it to
            speed around campus. It has a top speed of 22 mph on flat ground!

              A list of challenges faced with this bike:
            </p>

              <br/>
              <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
                <li>
                  The motor mounting interrupted the cable routing for the shifter, so I had to cut up a rubber cable guide and re-route the cables until
                  everything barely fit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The chainring that attaches to the motor was too large and it interfered with the frame of the bike, so I had to cut and file the frame down.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The pedals and aluminum crank arms were not intended to take the force of me jumping on and off the bike. Stripped two crank arms at the point
                  where the pedals thread into them.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Motor controller would cut off power to the motor once you hit a certain speed, so I had to disable the magnetic speed sensor to make for a smoother ride.
                </li>
                <li>
                  My rubber handle bars liquified in the summer sun.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mountain bike tire tread gets worn down when you brake a heavy bike going fast.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Brake pads get worn down quickly when you brake a heavy bike going fast.
                </li>
                <li>
                  My forward and rear lights weren't bolted down and they were stolen. 
                </li>
              </ul>
