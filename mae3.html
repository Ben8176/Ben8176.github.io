          My team and I built a robot with a 3 pronged claw and 4-bar lift using a limited selection of parts. The competition was for the
          Intro to Mechanical Design class, and the objective of the game was to retrieve objects with different properties from 4 locations
          at different heights.

            class="max-w-xl"
          />
          The component that I did the most work on was the drivetrain. Given two high-speed and low torque motors, I had to design a method
          to allow our robot to move around the game field. I opted for a friction drive that held the motor shafts onto the wheels as it was
          a straightforward power transmission that created a large gear ratio between the motor shaft and the wheel.
