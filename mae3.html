          For the Winter Quarter MAE3 - Intro to Mechanical Design class, my team and I built a robot with a 6 pronged claw, 4-bar lift, and friction drivetrain using a limited selection of parts and actuators and while under severe time constraints. The objective of the game was to retrieve different size and shaped objects from 4 locations and place them into a cubby.

          The component that I did the most work on was the drivetrain. Given two high-speed and low torque motors, I had to design a method
          to allow our robot to move around the game field. I opted for a friction drive that held the motor shafts onto the wheels as it was
          a straightforward power transmission that created a large gear ratio between the motor shaft and the wheel. This design was easy to CAD, manufacture, and test.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          The robot moved on two laser-cut acrylic wheels and used delrin sliders to distribute the rest of the weight.
          <br/>
          <br/>

          I was also involved in the design, prototyping, and integration of our other subsystems: the 4-bar lift and the 6 pronged claw.
