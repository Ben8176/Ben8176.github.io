      <p>
        Over my 2022 summer internship at <a href="https://www.hoodtechmechanical.com/">Hood Tech Mechanical</a>, I worked on getting UAV health information from speed controllers (ESCs) via CAN and generating pre-flight checks and warnings to display to a ground stationHUD. I was also involved with every step of ESC production and testing, from mechanical assembly and soldering to fully integrating on a group 2 VTOL UAS. 
      </p>
      <br/> <br/>
      <p>
        My main project was to take advantage of the CAN bus communication that these ESCs offered to report data such as ESC voltage,current, and temperature. To do this, 8-16 ESCs needed to be added to a CAN bus bar and plugged into the autopilot. This caused issues when the amount of data being spit out by the speed controllers exceeded the limits of the CAN protocol bandwidth, so I figured out away to throttle the data rates while still maintaining usability.

      <p>
        After the ESCs were able to communicate via CAN, I worked on firmware in C++ to factor the ESC data into our automatic pre-flight checks system. Previously, there was no way for operators/pilots to easily confirm that all 8-16 speed controllers were receiving the correct voltages, that all the individual UAV batteries were giving nominal voltages, and that all 8-16 ESCs had initialized and were flight ready (voltage being supplied and healthy PWM signal being received).
      </p>

      <br/>

      <p>
        For the production of the ESCs, I started by soldering the DC in and 3 phase out wires and assembling the ESC in its housing. After that, the ESCs needed to be potted with epoxy and cured upright overnight to water-proof them. The potted ESCs then underweight stress testing as they ran the loaded motors with propellers attached at full throttle for several minutes.
